    As Enzo Ferrari saw it, he was in the business of selling cars in order to
    fuel his passion for racing. Those two vectors collided in 1957 with Enzo on
    the verge of insolvency. His solution: win the Mille Miglia (Thousand
    Miles), Italy's preeminent endurance race during the first half of the 20th
    Century. With the fame and glory and attention of such a victory would come
    increased sales, and as a result, make Ferrari attractive to financiers on
    his terms. The Mille Miglia was a dangerous race in a dangerous era of
    racing. But the focus required makes the act of racing something akin to
    meditation, in the estimation of actor Patrick Dempsey, who stars as 1957
    Mille Migila victor Piero Tarrufi and who has earned his share of podium
    finishes as a driver himself. With potential dangers lurking at every turn,
    there's a cleansing process of the mind where all extraneous thought
    recedes.
