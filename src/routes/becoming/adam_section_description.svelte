    The complex characterization at the center of FERRARI was a perfect role for
    actor Adam Driver, who immersed himself in Mannâ€™s process and the
    intricacies of portraying Enzo Ferrari. Driver is a singular figure in
    American cinema, utilizing ferocity, wryness, and serious-mindedness in
    equal measure. For FERRARI, the two-time Oscar nominee researched the life
    of the man he would play, studying his decisions, his history, how he moved,
    breathed, walked, and talked. It would serve to inform a subtle performance
    underscored by almost-constant inner struggle. That quality of internally
    understanding a character is what Mann chases in his work, from the casting
    process to research with his actors to guiding them through a performance on
    set. Driver sat in hair-and-makeup for four hours each day to physically
    embody Enzo, but being put through the rigors of actually racing a Ferrari
    car during pre-production is what helped the actor hone the mentality of the
    man he was portraying. The finite attention required at the wheel of a
    vehicle reaching speeds of 150 miles per hour spoke to Ferrari's mindset as
    a business man of myopic focus and an engineer of unwavering vision and
    precision.
