    For the role of Laura Ferrari, Enzo Ferrari's wife and partner in the
    Ferrari factory's business, Michael Mann was drawn to Oscar-winning actress
    Penélope Cruz. Like Enzo, Laura continues to grieve for the loss of their
    son, Guido. When she discovers the second family Enzo has started with
    wartime mistress Lina Lardi, she's heartbroken and angered, both on her own
    behalf and that of their dead son. Enzo trusts her implicitly with the
    business of Ferrari, such that he once fired an entire engineering staff out
    of solidarity with her when they complained about her meddling. Yet, she was
    a constant thorn in his side given the 50/50 sway she held over the company.
    It's a mountain of complexity and Cruz tackled it with trademark verve, and
    she adopted a physicality in her rendering of Laura that would reveal a
    woman afflicted with hardship. Mann even suggested the actress wear
    orthopedic shoes to give her a bit of a waddle, an outward representation of
    her burdened soul. Cruz and Driver ultimately reveal a passion between Enzo
    and Laura that may have chilled over the years, but the embers of that
    former fire linger still.
