    In life, when a thing works better, usually it is more beautiful to the eye.
    That's how Enzo Ferrari puts it to his son Piero in a scene from FERRARI.
    Director Michael Mann often calls Ferrari race cars moving sculpture, while
    noting the irony that they are not self-consciously designed as such. So,
    all the technological innovation and Italian intuition that goes into their
    design and manufacture became another area of exploration, as Mann tasked
    his team with creating a fleet of race cars from the ground up. Using
    specially designed chassis, 3D LiDAR scans of actual race cars — which of
    course couldn't be used in the film themselves, given their extraordinary
    value — and hand-crafted metal and fiberglass sculpts, the production
    succeeded in replicating the cars with a blend of old-world techniques and
    modern-day technology. Once they were painted and camera-ready, actors
    Patrick Dempsey (Piero Taruffi), Gabriel Leone (Alfonso De Portago) and Jack
    O'Connell (Peter Collins) could have their fun. Real-life racing drivers
    including actor Patrick Dempsey (Piero Taruffi), Derek Hill and Marino
    Franchitti also star as Jean Behra and Eugenio Castellotti, respectively,
    two celebrated drivers of the 1950s.
