    While the complexity of the drama within FERRARI attracted filmmaker Michael
    Mann to the material, he also holds a striking kinship with the subject at
    its center. Enzo Ferrari was a man driven by a lust for racing, his
    "terrible joy," as he called it in life and in the title of his own
    autobiography. The determination and precision required for that pursuit is
    a work ethic with which Mann can relate. Each of his films stands as the
    result of intense investigation and detailed thought, from heavily
    researched period authenticity to deep dives with actors into the tumultuous
    internal lives of their characters. The design of FERRARI as a big-picture
    narrative, meanwhile, was to provide contrast with how its separate dramas
    were depicted visually, the classical aesthetic of its intimate scenes
    slashed across by the film's riveting racing sequences and the savage power
    of the red cars. precision.
